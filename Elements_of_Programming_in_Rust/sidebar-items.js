For example, the parity of 1011 is 1, and the parity of 10001000 is 0. Parity checks are used to detect single bit errors in data storage and communication. It is fairly straightforward to write code that computes the parity of a single 64-bit word. How would you compute the parity of a very large number of 64-bit words?

As an example, consider the following sequence of stock prices: <31.0,31.5,275,295,260,270,290,230,255,250>. The maximum profit that can be made with one buy and one sell is 30-buy at 260 and sell at 290. Note that 250 is not the lowest price, nor 290 the highest price. 46Write program that takes an array denoting the daily stock price, and retums the maximum profit that could be made by buying and then selling one share of that stock. There is no need to buy if a no profit is possible. Hint:ldentifying the minimum and maximum height.

Your code should handle negative integers. You cannot use library functions like int in Python. Implement an integer to string conversion function, and a string to integer conversison function, For example, if the input to the first function is the integer 314,it should retum the string \"31.4\" and if the input to the second function is the string \"314\" it should return the integer 314.
